Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS - Fast XS inherited and class accessors

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  #install accessors at compile time
  use Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS 
      inherited => [qw/foo bar/], # inherited accessors with key names equal to accessor names
      class     => [qw/baz/],     # an anonymous non-inherited accessor for __PACKAGE__
      varclass  => [qw/boo/],     # non-inherited accessor for __PACKAGE__,  aliased with 'our $boo' variable
  ;
  
  use Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS { # optional braces
      inherited => {
        bar => 'bar_key',
        foo => 'foo_key',
      },
      class     => ['baz'],
      varclass  => ['boo'],
  };
  
  #or in a Class::Accessor::Grouped-like fashion
  use parent 'Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS';
  
  __PACKAGE__->mk_inherited_accessors('foo', ['bar', 'bar_key']);
  __PACKAGE__->mk_class_accessors('baz');
  __PACKAGE__->mk_varclass_accessors('boo');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a very fast implementation for 'inherited' accessors, that were introduced
by the L<Class::Accessor::Grouped> module. They give you a capability to override values set in
a parent class with values set in childs or object instances. Generated accessors are compatible with
L<Class::Accessor::Grouped> generated ones.

Since this module focuses primary on speed, it provides no means to have your own per-class
getters/setters logic (like overriding L<Class::Accessor::Grouped/get_inherited> / L<Class::Accessor::Grouped/set_inherited>),
but it allows you to register a single get/set callback per accessor type.

It also provides two types of non-inherited accessors, 'class' and 'varclass', which give you values
from a package they were defined in, even when called on objects. The difference between them is that
the 'varclass' internal storage is a package variable with the same name, while 'class' stores it's value
in an anonymous variable.

=head1 UTF-8 AND BINARY SAFETY

Starting with the perl 5.16.0, this module provides full support for UTF-8 method names and hash keys.
But on older perls you can't distinguish UTF-8 strings from bytes string in method names, so accessors
with UTF-8 names can end up getting a wrong value. You have been warned.

From 5.16.0 and onwards, accessors installation is also binary safe, except for the Windows platform.
This module croaks on attempts to install binary accessors on unsupported platforms.

=head1 THREADS

Though highly discouraged, perl threads are supported by L<Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS>. You may
have accessors with same names pointing to different keys in different threads, etc. There are
no known conceptual leaks.

=head1 PERFORMANCE

L<Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS> is at least 10x times faster than L<Class::Accessor::Grouped>, depending
on your usage pattern. Accessing data from a parent in a large inheritance chain is still the worst case,
but even there L<Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS> beats L<Class::Accessor::Grouped> best-case.

Accessors with just an empty sub callback are ~3x times slower then normal ones, so use them only when you definitely need them.

Here are results from a benchmark run on perl 5.20.1 (see bench folder):

=head1 EXTENDING

    package MyAccessor;
    # 'register_type' isn't exported
    Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS::register_type(
        inherited_cb => {on_read => sub {}, on_write => sub{}},
    );

    package MyClass;
    use MyAccessor;
    use Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS {
        inherited    => ['foo'],
        inherited_cb => ['bar'],

    __PACKAGE__->mk_type_accessors(inherited_cb => 'foo', 'bar');

You can register new inherited accessor types with associated read/write callbacks. Unlike
L<Class::Accessor::Grouped>, only a single callback is set for a type, without per-class
 get_*/set_* lookups.

B<on_read> callback gets a single argument - from a normal 'inherited' accessor. It's return value is the new
accessor's return value (and is not stored anywhere).

B<on_write> callback gets two arguments - original args from the accessor's call. It's return value is saved
instead of the user's supplied one. Exceptions thrown from this callback will cancel store and leave the old value unchanged.

=head1 PROFILING WITH Devel::NYTProf

To perform it's task, L<Devel::NYTProf> hooks into the perl interpreter by replacing default behaviour for calling subroutines
on the opcode level. To squeeze last bits of performance, L<Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS> does the same, but separately
on each call site of its accessors. It turns out into CAIX favor - L<Devel::NYTProf> sees only first call to CAIX
accessor, but all subsequent ones become invisible to the subs profiler.

Note that the statement profiler still correctly accounts for the time spent on each line, you just don't see time spent in accessors'
calls separately. That's sometimes OK, sometimes not - you get profile with all possible optimizations on, but it's not easy to comprehend.

Since it's hard to detect L<Devel::NYTProf> (and any other module doing such magic) in a portable way (all hail Win32), there's
an %ENV switch available - you can set CAIXS_DISABLE_ENTERSUB to a true value to disable opcode optimization and get a full subs profile.
